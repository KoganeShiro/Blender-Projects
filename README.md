### Starting my journey
Like many of people wanting to start their journey into the 3D world, Blender is the perfect free and open source solution in order to begin. And what a better way to dive into it by making a donut 😁 ?

I think the donut is kind of the print hello world in programming. A must first step by many.
This tutorial made by [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru) will teach you how to get start.
